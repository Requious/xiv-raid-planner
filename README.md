# XIV Raid Planner

The motivation for this project came from me being very inefficient with Astrologian
cooldowns in savage raids.

Knowing how far in advance I could throw Macrocosmos, Horoscope, or activate Neutral Sect
and have it come up again for the next big raid damage mechanic was mostly trial and error.

The hope of this project is to be able to map boss timelines, and individual cooldowns onto a
single screen to know where things can be moved around to optimize skill uptime.

Maybe eventually this can integrate with ACT for reminders of when certain skills and abilities
should be used according to a raid plan.
